BWTA is a add-on for BWAPI that analyzes the map and computes the regions, chokepoints, and base locations. BWTA is only aimed to analyze "normal" maps, i.e. ICCup maps or other competitive starcraft maps. So don't be surprised if it crashes or produces strange results for maps like [http://classic.battle.net/images/battle/scc/lp/bw02/cy.jpg Crystallis] or other [http://starcraft.wikia.com/wiki/Money_maps money maps].
